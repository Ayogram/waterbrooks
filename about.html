            Waterbrooks Ministry International (WMI) is a Christ‑centered teaching and apostolic
            ministry led by Apostle Niyi Aniya, with a mandate to raise believers who are deeply
            rooted in Christ and equipped to live out the gospel with clarity, power, and purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision is to see lives transformed by the knowledge of Christ, as men and women
            come to understand and walk in the fullness of His finished work—His death, burial,
            and resurrection. At Waterbrooks, we believe that true spiritual growth flows from an
            intimate relationship with Jesus and a firm grounding in the Word of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to evangelism, discipleship, and spiritual formation through sound
            biblical teaching, fervent prayer, and intentional outreach. Our services are
            characterized by an atmosphere of worship where the Holy Spirit is welcomed to
            minister through prayer, the gifts of the Spirit, and the teaching of the Word,
            producing mature believers who reflect Christ in every sphere of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Waterbrooks Ministry International, the Word of God is upheld as the final
            authority for faith and doctrine. We proclaim the gospel of grace, affirming that our
            righteousness and identity are found solely in Christ and His redemptive work. Through
            His grace, believers are empowered to live victoriously and to serve God faithfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the leadership of Apostle Niyi Aniya, Waterbrooks Ministry International
            continues to grow as a community of believers passionate about knowing Christ and
            making Him known. Our story is still unfolding, and by God’s grace, we are committed
            to raising disciples and releasing ministers who will carry the light of the gospel to
            their world—one life at a time.

                “I want to testify of God’s unfailing faithfulness and the fulfillment of His
                promises in my life. Late last year, God gave me a word: He said He was
                opening the doors of nations unto me. I held on to that promise and
                trusted Him completely. Today, by His grace, I am standing in the United
                Kingdom as a living testimony to His covenant‑keeping nature. It didn’t even
                take six months for God to fulfill what He had spoken over my life.”

              <p>
                “I want to share this testimony because it shows how much God pays
                attention to us and how He can remove obstacles that hinder us from
                fellowshipping with Him. On the first day of last year’s retreat, I came
                down with a terrible head cold. Those kinds that with every sneeze the
                headache becomes more painful and throbbing. But by the end of the
                service, I was completely healed without any medication.”

                Through a simple act of faith and obedience, He raised helpers who paid
                the exact amount needed. This miracle reminded me that God truly supplies
                all our needs according to His riches in glory.”
